Overview

The attached c++ program explains the creation of sparse matrix where most of the time it contains only zero values. The program stores nonzero elements in memory by maintaining their row and column positions which results in both memory efficiency and performance improvement. The program displays two matrices through visual output by using three arrays to store row data and column data and value data.

Features of sparse matrix array

When we run this program usually it represents normal 2D array into converted sparse matrix array representation.

The main feature of sparse is it only stores non-zero elements, it uses three arrays to store row,column and value.

Another interesting thing is it shows both the representations one is the original matrix and other is sparse matrix.
